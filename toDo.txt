List of things left to do or implement
actually use this please
note that bugs can be noted down here

- get cards displayed properly using CSS grid
- have shop-like filter for teachers
- add cancel icon to search bar, and have search bar reset when page is reloaded
- move the highlighted class (in search bar) up/down using up/down arrow keys
- when card is clicked, have card expand (not a seperate page), showing:
    • a nice table of contents (without page numbers; it would just have the sections — each section is it's own PDF file - and the subtopics in that section)
    • a nice list of files to download
    • a cancel icon to collapse the expanded card
- set up upload of documents part --> raffi

PDF.js library can be used if we need --> no need. PDF files will just be downloaded

Jinja for cards:
{% for i in range(0, cards|length) %}
{% endfor %}
