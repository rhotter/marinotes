List of things left to do or implement
actually use this please
note that bugs can be noted down here

- get links to work on search bar
The problem is I have an "onBlur()" event handler for the <input> tag. The handler checks if you click out of the text field and closes the menu if so. But when you click on a button on the dropdown, it triggers the onBlur() since it's a click outside the textfield. So it closes the dropdown menu before it can redirect to the link.

- template page for courses (first set up cards, then get filter working)
- move the highlighted class (in search bar) up/down using up/down arrow keys


PDF.js library can be used if we need
(allows us to display pdfs and have a next page previous page system which can be nice
