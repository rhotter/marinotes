List of things left to do or implement
actually use this please
note that bugs can be noted down here

- Why are cards generated from JS? They can be in HTML but hidden using JS

- template page for courses (first set up cards, then get filter working)
- move the highlighted class (in search bar) up/down using up/down arrow keys


PDF.js library can be used if we need
(allows us to display pdfs and have a next page previous page system which can be nice
